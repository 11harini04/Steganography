# Steganography

Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, by embedding it into an audio, video, image or text file. It is one of the methods employed to protect secret or sensitive data from malicious attacks.

Image Steganography refers to the process of hiding data within an image file. The image selected for this purpose is called the cover-image and the image obtained after steganography is called the stego-image. It is more difficult to determine whether the file contain hidden messages or not.

I have implemented a basic implementation of image steganography in Python.
